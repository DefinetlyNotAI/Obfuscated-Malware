Setup
1) Have the 2 files ready, usually one is the malware and another is a normal file
2) Select both, and right click to the menu
3) Check the box that says "SFX Archive"
4) Go to the advanced menu, and go to "SFX options"
5) Go to the "Setup" Tab
6) Type the files in the order they should open
7) Go to the "Modes" Tab
8) Select "Unpack to temp folder" and "Hide All"
Optional) Go to the "Text & Icon" Tab
Optional) Choose the same icon as the good file to further obfuscate it
9) Go to "Update" Tab and select "Overwrite existing files"
10) Click Ok twice
11) Remove the 2 files
12) A new EXE is made that when opened does both!

Note: The images are a tester for me, but later I used batch files as they are safer to distribute in github.
Note: Software used is WinRAR.. May not work with others.

This new exe will first run the first program, and after it closes does it run the second... This could be used in reverse engineering, social engineering and online trickery.. Someone may distribute it as a safe program.. and the antivirus wont even pick it up (Tested only on IoBit), The malware used could be a silent malware that runs in the background, thus obfuscating itself and remaining anonymous!
